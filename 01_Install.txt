TIP:
Depending on you level of knowledge of your own comfyui local intall and pipeline,
maybe try step 2 first, cause maybe you already meet all the requirements,
so after going over step 2 open comfy and try the node, if all works fine skip step 1,
if not close comfy and go over step 1, then run comfy again.


Step 1. Node Dependencies

-(follow this step with caution, always backup your ComfyUI python environment before installing any new package)-

**Required packages for this node:**
- `pygame` - Display window and rendering
- `screeninfo` - Multi-monitor support  
- `opencv-python` - Video processing *(Video Monitor only)*
- `pillow` - Image format support *(Video Monitor only)*

**Installation command:**
```cmd
pip install pygame screeninfo opencv-python pillow

Step 2. Remove old PreviewVideoMonitorPro from your "custom_nodes" folder if exists.

Step 3. Install in custom_nodes

Drop "PreviewVideoMonitorPro" folder in "custom_nodes" comfyui´s folder

THAT´S IT
